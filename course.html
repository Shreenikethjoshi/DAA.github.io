                An algorithm must be seen to be believed; its beauty lies in its logic. Efficient solutions are born not just from code, but from understanding. Design with clarity, analyze with precision, optimize with purpose. Great algorithms solve problems elegantly and stand the test of time.

                <h3>Course Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), where problem-solving meets the beauty of efficient computation. This course lays the foundation of computer science, empowering you to organize, manage, and process data with remarkable efficiency. You'll explore an array of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs, while diving into a variety of algorithms, including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

                <h3>What is the Course About</h3>
                <p>
                    Our course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, introduces us to the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, focusing on their design, analysis, and application. We start with core concepts like time and space complexities, recursion, and backtracking. Next, we delve into tools like hashing and Union-Find, along with advanced data structures such as AVL Trees, Segment Trees, and Red-Black Trees.
