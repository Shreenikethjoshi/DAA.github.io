                This course introduced me to the foundational principles of algorithm design, optimization, and problem-solving techniques. 
                It helped me understand how to tackle complex computational challenges effectively and efficiently.

            <h3>ðŸ”¢ Data Structures Studied</h3>
            <div class="data-structures">
                <h4>1. Binary Search Tree (BST)</h4>
                <p>
                    A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure where nodes are arranged so that the left subtree contains smaller elements 
                    and the right subtree contains larger elements. Visualizing tree structures and their dynamic updates during insertion and deletion 
                    was challenging. However, understanding how BSTs are used in databases for efficient data retrieval was an exciting application.
                </p>
                <h4>2. DFS and BFS (Graph Traversals)</h4>
                <p>
                    DFS explores nodes as deep as possible before backtracking, while BFS explores nodes level by level. I found it important to understand 
                    when to use BFS for shortest path problems and DFS for backtracking problems.
                </p>
                <h4>3. Heap</h4>
                <p>
                    A heap maintains the heap property, where the root is the minimum (min-heap) or maximum (max-heap) element. Implementing heaps 
                    for priority queues and real-time scheduling applications was a crucial learning experience.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Sorting Algorithms</h4>
                <p>
                    Sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and bubble sort were studied. I learned to select the most appropriate sorting algorithm 
                    based on dataset size and constraints.
                </p>
                <h4>5. Pattern Searching</h4>
                <p>
                    Algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp efficiently search for substrings in larger strings. I appreciated the optimization and pattern-matching 
                    techniques employed in large-scale search engines.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Graph Algorithms</h4>
                <p>
                    I worked on Dijkstra's (shortest path), Kruskal's (MST), and other graph algorithms, learning their applications in real-world systems 
                    like GPS navigation and social networks.
                </p>

            <h3>ðŸŒŸ Connecting the Course to Real-Time Applications</h3>
            <p>
                By applying the concepts learned in this course, I developed a Parking Management System, which utilizes graph algorithms to find the 
                nearest parking spot based on user location. This real-world application highlights the power of data structures and algorithms in solving practical problems.
